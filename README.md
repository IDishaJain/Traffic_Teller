# Vehicle Detection and Counting 

A web application that detects, classifies, and counts vehicles from uploaded videos using computer vision techniques. It generates a vehicle distribution chart for visual analysis, aiding in traffic management and urban planning.

Vehicle tracking involves identifying and following vehicle movements through video surveillance, playing a crucial role in modern traffic monitoring systems. This application supports key functions such as traffic flow analysis, vehicle counting, and public safetyâ€”all in a cost-effective and scalable solution.
